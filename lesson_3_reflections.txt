Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When you're using multiple computers/devices to access your repo or when there are multiple people contributing to the codebase.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Auto updates may lead to code that isn't ready for public consumption being pushed to GitHub

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: Forks are a way of 'cloning' repos on GitHub while giving credit to the original author. Clones refer to copies of a repo. Branches are subsets of the master codebase, usually used for experiments or trying out new features.
