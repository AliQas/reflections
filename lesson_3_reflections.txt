Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When you're using multiple computers/devices to access your repo or when there are multiple people contributing to the codebase.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Auto updates may lead to code that isn't ready for public consumption being pushed to GitHub
